# Flight Data Management

## Overview
The Flight Data Management project is designed to manage and process flight-related data efficiently. It implements a data management process that includes extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data into a reconciled database and a data warehouse. The project is structured to facilitate easy maintenance and scalability.

```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd flight-data-management
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the database connection settings in `config/settings.py`.

4. Run the application:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- The application can be extended by adding new models in the `src/models` directory.
- ETL processes can be modified in the `src/etl` directory to accommodate new data sources or transformations.
- Unit tests can be added or modified in the `tests` directory to ensure code reliability.
